# Reliving Avengers: Infinity War with spaCy and Natural Language Processing

## Overview
This repo contains the scripts used in my latest experiment titled _Reliving Avengers: Infinity War with spaCy and Natural Language Processing_.

Using spaCy, an NLP Python open source library designed to help us process and understand volumes of text, I analyzed the script of the movie to investigate the following concepts:
- Overall top 10 verbs, nouns, adverbs and adjectives from the film.
- Top verbs and nouns spoke by a particular character
- Top 30 named entities from the film
- The similarity between the lines spoken by each character pair, e.g., the similarity between Thor's and Thanos' lines.

## Tools used
- Python
- spaCy
